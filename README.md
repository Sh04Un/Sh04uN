Tech Lead at **Pentaframe OÜ**  
Software Architect • Full-Stack Developer • DevOps-oriented Engineer

I design and build reliable software systems, from low-level infrastructure to high-level applications.

## 🧠 About Me

I started studying programming in **2016**, beginning with **Java**, and consolidated my technical foundations over the following years.  
I entered the professional field in **2019**, working for two years in a company environment before transitioning into **independent consulting**.

In **2022**, I co-founded **Pentaframe**, where we design and deliver a wide range of solutions:
- custom software platforms
- infrastructure and DevOps setups
- hardware and networking solutions
- web and mobile applications
- blockchain-based systems
- cybersecurity-aware architectures

Technology is not just my job — it is my main passion and the field I continuously invest my time and energy into.
